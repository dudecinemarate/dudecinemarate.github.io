        <h6 id="intro">Notes on Ratings</h6>
        <p>&#8226; Movie ratings are rounded down to the nearest half star.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Recommended movies are any movies with at least one rating of 4 or more stars.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Horny and date movies are any movies deemed horny or date worthy, respectively, by at least one reviewer.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Horny and date movies marked with hesitancy (,but...) should be taken with a degree of caution (only specific circumstances apply, few and far between applications, etc).</p>
        <p>&#8226; Patreon episodes released to the main feed are listed as their original release on Patreon.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Movies will generally be updated within the week of airing, but there may be occasional delays.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Minor data discrepencies may be present between the original episodes, Matt's data, and David's data &amp; website.</p>
